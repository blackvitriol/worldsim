# worldsim
WorldSim is my personal project. I want to develop a cloud based GIS that supports IoT. This means we are going to virtualize everything that in the world. Imagine using Google Earth as a first-person simulator and seeing people walking and cars moving around in real-time.

Every robot can connect to the Internet and load a virtual model of Earth on itself. This will allow it to contribute its local information to the cloud system as well as access and use data of unknown environments. Thus, a global environment modelling tool can be deployed for use in Robotics.

**GIS Roadmap:**
 - Topography Data: Land/Sea + Height Map
 - Boundaries: Continents, Countries...see below
 - Street Data: Roads and Addreses.
 - Transportation: Populate roads with traffic
 - Buildings Data: (Occupied Land)
 - Vegetation Data: Trees, plants, etc.
 
 Goal: To create a simulation of the world, which can be acccess by physical robots for SLAM, as well as for virtual experiences by humans.

Can we eventually model every voxel in the universe ?


**Planet > Continents > Countries > States    > City/Town    > District > Road/Street Address > Co-ordinates (x,y,z)**
Earth  > America     > USA      > Virginia  > Alexandria   > Rosemont > 2823 King Street    > latitude, longitude and elevation

** Fields of Knowledge/Information/Data:**
Geodesy (geodetics engineering), Computer Sciences, Information Technology
